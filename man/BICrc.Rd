\title{
BIC function 
}
\description{
A function gives the BIC value based on estimated results from \code{\link{concavefusion}}. Cn = c0log(log(np+q)) with repeated measures
}
\usage{
BICrc(indexy, obj, y, z, x, c0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{output of concavefusion}
  \item{indexy}{numeric numbers, index of repeated meausre sort assending}
  \item{y}{ response vector with n observations .}
  \item{z}{ explanatory variables matrix which have the same coefficients among individuals.}
  \item{x}{ explanatory variables matrix with p columns which have individual coefficients.}
  \item{c0}{numeric value used in modified BIC, default value is 0.2.}
}
\details{
BICc is a specical case of BICcr without repeated measures. Cn in BIC c0log(log(np + q)).
}
\value{
a numeric BIC value
